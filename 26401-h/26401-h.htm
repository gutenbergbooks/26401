	<h2 class="title">The Most Marvellous Triumph of Educational Science.</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">In</span> the dull atmosphere which stagnates between the high walls of
	colleges and churches wherein play the little eddies of fashionable
	literature, which considers the authorship of an old play<a href="#footnote_1" id="fnm1" title="Mr. Lowell..." class="fnmarker">1</a> more
	interesting and important than the questions that involve the welfare
	of all humanity or the destiny of a nation,—an atmosphere
	seldom stirred by the strong, pure breezes of the mountain and the
	ocean,—the best thought and impulse of which humanity is capable
	is stifled in its birth, or if it comes forth feels the overshadowing
	influence that chills its life.</p>

	<p>Not there, amid the pedantries of “culture,” do we find the atmosphere
	for free and benevolent thought, but rather far away from
	such influences, in the forests, the mountain and prairie, where man
	comes more nearly into communion with nature, and forgets the
	inheritance of ancient error which every corporate institution preserves
	and perpetuates. It is to this widespread audience that the
	<cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite> appeals and offers a new suggestion.</p>

	<p>In sending forth the “New Education,” hoping for some appreciative
	response from educational circles in which collegiate influences
	prevail, I did not deem it prudent to introduce some of the noblest
	thoughts that belong to the great theme. The book was sent forth
	limited and incomplete, hoping that, heretical as it was, and quite
	irreverent toward the ignorance descended from antiquity, it might
	still receive sufficient approbation and appreciation to justify later
	introduction of matter that would have hindered its first reception.</p>

	<p>It has reached the third edition, but it has been very apparent
	that its reception was cordial and enthusiastic only among the most
	<a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"> </a>progressive minds, the number of which increases as we travel westward,
	and San Francisco called for more copies than the leading
	cities of the East.</p>

	<p>The time has now arrived (when this <cite class="name">Journal</cite> is hailed cordially
	throughout the country) that I may venture to announce the most
	remarkable feature of the art and science of education. There is an
	additional reason, too, for speaking out at this time, which should
	mortify the pride of an American citizen. The philanthropic science
	which I thought it imprudent to mention then in this free country,
	is beginning to be studied in France, where such themes are not
	suppressed by the sturdy dogmatism which is so prevalent and so
	powerful in the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>



	<h3>THE NEW METHOD IN FRANCE.</h3>

	<p>As the French National Scientific Association, in their meeting at
	Grenoble, two years ago, recognized in their most startling form the
	phenomena of human impressibility which are illustrated in the
	“Manual of Psychometry,” and reported the most marvellous
	experiments in medicines,—an act of liberality which has no
	parallel in English-speaking nations,—so at the late meeting of
	their Scientific Congress, as I learn from the German magazine, the
	<cite>Sphinx</cite>, the new principle of education was broached which I feared
	to present in the “New Education,” and was received with general
	approbation by that learned body.</p>

	<p>Of course there was not a complete presentation of the subject,
	for that would require a complete knowledge of the brain, which no
	scientific association claims at present, and which will have its first
	presentation to the readers of the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>, but the process
	of educational development was studied by the French <em>savants</em>
	from the standpoint of mesmeric science and its leading methods,
	which are now (freed from the name of an individual) styled
	<em>hypnotism</em>; or, the sleep-producing process.</p>

	<p>In that passive and impressionable condition which is called
	hypnotic, mesmeric, somnambulic, or somniloquent, it has long been
	known that the subject may be absolutely controlled by the operator,
	or by a simple command or suggestion, or by his own imagination.
	This has been so often demonstrated before many hundred
	thousands of spectators, that it is a matter of general knowledge
	everywhere among intelligent people,—everywhere except, perhaps,
	in the thick darkness of medical colleges, where ignorance upon
	such subjects has long been made the criterion of respectability, and
	perhaps among a few very orthodox congregations, where such
	things have been associated with the idea of witchcraft, and considered
	very offensive to the Lord. Such was the doctrine of my
	old contemporary at Cincinnati, Dr. Wilson, at the head of the leading
	orthodox congregation; and it was equally offensive to the champion
	debater of Presbyterian orthodoxy, the Rev. N. L. Rice, whom
	I arraigned before a vast audience for his antiquated falsehoods. If
	the church and the college are getting a <em>little</em> more enlightened now,
	I cannot forget the condition in which I found them, of stubborn
	<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"> </a>hostility to scientific progress, and these things <em>should not be forgotten</em>
	until they have repented, reformed, and ceased to be a stationary
	obstruction.</p>

	<p>We are not accustomed to look to a Catholic country like France
	for advanced thought, yet, in these instances just mentioned, we find
	French scientists entertaining advanced ideas which the leaders of
	American science treat with either indifference or hostility. The
	<cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite> and medical journals generally treat all
	such matters with stubborn aversion and injustice. The learned
	collaborators of Johnson’s Cyclopedia were unwilling even to have
	the science of psychometry mentioned in it, and it was introduced
	by the publisher against their protest. These things I mention now,
	that the great public to which I appeal may better understand the
	real value of the opinions of those who stand in positions of authority
	and influence.</p>

	<p>I would not wish to diminish by harsh criticism the sentiment of
	reverence which is already too feeble in the American mind. We
	cannot be too reverent to real intellectual and moral greatness, but
	to reverence beyond their worth the teachers of old inherited falsehoods,
	is to be a traitor to truth. The literature of to-day is controlled
	by ancient or mediæval errors, and the fresh science seeking
	expression in the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite> could not have found expression
	in periodical literature. Our leading periodicals would not
	have opened their pages to the exposition of educational methods
	which is to be given in this essay. <em>Intolerance</em> is the inheritance
	which the generation of to-day has received from ancestors who two
	or three centuries ago delighted in hanging or even burning the
	exponents of opinions contrary to their own; and where intolerance
	is not in the way, the energy of literary cliques is exerted to hold
	exclusive possession of the field.</p>

	<p>With this exordium, which the occasion seemed to require, let us
	proceed to consider the most powerful and radical measure, which
	belongs to the science of education, and which has been developed
	by the science of anthropology.</p>



	<h3>DEFINITION OF EDUCATION.</h3>

	<p>Education, rightly understood, signifies the development of all the
	faculties or capacities of the soul, and, as a necessary consequence,
	of the brain, in which that soul is lodged, and of the body, which is
	as essential to the brain as the brain is to the soul. For without the
	brain there is no soul expression, and in proportion to the condition
	and development of the brain is the expression of all the soul faculties.
	A soft and watery brain is always accompanied by feebleness
	of character and mind. In like manner the manifestations of the
	brain depend for their strength upon the body, when the lungs and
	heart fail to send a vigorous current of arterial blood to the brain, its
	power declines proportionally; and when the current ceases entirely,
	the action of the brain itself ceases, and with its cessation all manifestations
	of the soul cease also. Or when the disordered viscera fail
	to supply a healthy blood, as in fevers of a low type, the brain, like
	<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>all other organs, is brought down to the level of the depraved blood,
	and shows by its utter feebleness and by the incoherent expressions
	of the patient that brain and soul depend upon the body for their
	power and all their action in this life.<a href="#footnote_2" id="fnm2" title="The insane folly..." class="fnmarker">2</a></p>


	<h3>FOUR EDUCATIONAL METHODS.</h3>

	<p>The process of education by a teacher consists chiefly in establishing
	the control of his stronger mind over that of the pupil, by placing
	the latter in the most passive and receptive condition, in which
	the pupil not only receives the intelligence he gives, but also feels
	the influence of his will and principles.</p>

	<p>There are four methods by which the influence of the teacher is
	made effective: 1st, the power of conviction or reason; 2d, the spirit
	of obedience; 3d, the spirit of imitation; and 4th, the spirit of passive
	sympathy.</p>

	<p>In the first method he addresses the understanding, enabling the
	pupil to understand what is best for him. If Socrates had been
	right in maintaining that knowledge was the one thing needful to
	overcome practical errors, and that men sinned only through ignorance
	(which was a very grave mistake), this would be the most
	effective method of teaching. But it is effective only with those
	who are conscientious and thoughtful, who are seeking to do right,
	and need only to be instructed. It is entirely ineffective with the
	great majority of wrong doers, whose moral nature and self-control
	are insufficient to curb their animalism.</p>

	<p>The second method, the spirit of obedience, is the method of
	religion, which is far more effective. Jesus and other religious
	teachers impress their followers that there is a great and benevolent
	power, the power to which we are indebted for our present lives and
	our hope of unlimited future happiness,—to which we owe a profound
	gratitude, with an unhesitating love and obedience. Our
	love should not be withheld from our grand benefactor; and if his
	wisdom transcends our own, the wisest thing that we can do is to
	ascertain what that wisdom dictates, and obey it implicitly. That
	which we supremely love and reverence we delight in obeying.</p>



	<h3>OBEDIENCE AND IMITATION.</h3>

	<p>The teacher or parent, therefore, should endeavor to hold something
	like the Divine relation to the child,—should show a superiority
	of knowledge, an inflexible firmness, an unvarying love, and
	irresistible attraction, ever endeavoring to win love, while enforcing
	the supremacy of his will, so that obedience may be a pleasure.
	Thus may a woman with a masculine strength of will, or a man with
	feminine strength of love, develop that willing obedience which
	insures the moral elevation of the pupil. But whenever the teacher
	fails to elicit both respect and love, his power for good is lost. In
	<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>this evolution of good the power of the teacher is vastly enhanced
	by that of music, especially in the form of song, when the pupil is
	made to sing songs of exalted sentiment; and there are very few
	natures so depraved as to resist long the combined power of exalted
	music and a superior teacher, to which should be added the social
	influence of numbers already elevated by such influences.</p>

	<p>In such schools, the power of the third element, <em>imitation</em>, is very
	great, for the pupil is generally more influenced by the example of
	his numerous associates in the school and family, with whom he is
	continually in contact, than by that of his teacher.</p>

	<p>To get the full benefit of imitation requires not only the influence
	of well-trained schoolmates, but systematic exercises in reading,
	singing, declamation, and deportment, the teaching being given by
	example.</p>

	<p>When a boy or girl is taught by example to express a noble sentiment
	in a natural manner, he is thereby compelled to feel the sentiment
	in some degree with sincerity. When he is required to imitate
	and practice certain forms of politeness which express the best
	sentiments, those sentiments must gradually become a part of his
	nature. The acts of respect, of kindness and courtesy to which he
	may be naturally averse, cannot be daily practised without rousing
	in his nature the sentiments to which they correspond.</p>


	<h3>VALUE OF DANCING.</h3>

	<p>Among the many disciplinary methods which have been neglected
	in our educational systems, I would give a high rank to <em>dancing</em>.
	Rightly conducted, it embodies so much of grace, dignity, cheerfulness,
	playfulness, health, and the desire of pleasing, as to entitle it to
	a high rank in the promotion of health and virtue. Dancing is one
	of the imitative arts, and involves the amiable influence of imitation,
	as well as the more lively sentiments. The hostility of the orthodox
	churches to this refining exercise is probably the effect of the infernalism
	of their theology, which places mankind upon the brink of hell,
	in full view of the infinite agony of their friends, relatives, and ancestors,
	so as to render every sentiment but that of gloom and terror
	inappropriate. How bitter their hostility to all gaiety! “Yes,
	dance, young woman,” said a famous Methodist preacher about
	twenty years ago, “dance down to hell!” At the same time, his
	own private record did not indicate any deep sincerity in his fear of
	hell. The same hostility is still kept up, and overflows in the popular
	harangues of Rev. Sam Jones, and many others.</p>

	<p>Popular Christianity, in the majority of the churches, is therefore
	one of the greatest hindrances to a normal educational system, and
	to social refinement, notwithstanding its support of some of the
	essential virtues.</p>



	<h3>THE REVOLUTIONARY METHOD.</h3>

	<p>The fourth method, of <em>passive sympathy</em>, is the most scientific, the
	most novel and the most powerful of all,—the most competent to
	grasp the helpless, hopeless, half idiotic, and half criminal classes and
	restore them to normal intelligence and virtue. It was not mentioned
	<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>in the “New Education,” for fear of alarming the orthodox
	stolidity of the medical college and the church, but it will appear in
	future editions. It is the method of bringing the subject into absolute
	sympathy and absolute subordination under the operator.</p>

	<p>It has been known throughout this century that certain persons
	can be brought under the control of those of stronger wills, so as to
	realize the thoughts, and even sensations of the operator, feeling
	what he feels, tasting what he tastes, apparently more familiar with
	his body than their own, and passively subject to his will. They
	are said to be <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en rapport</em> with him, and with no one else. In this
	condition his will is substituted for their own, which is entirely passive,
	and he is able to fix impressions on their minds and produce
	changes in their feelings and sentiments which may remain after his
	control is removed.</p>

	<p>It is self-evident that in this process we have the most powerful
	lever ever discovered for uplifting the fallen, and doing more in an
	hour than can be done by the usual methods in many months. Why,
	then, have we not had the benefit of this potent method throughout
	the century? The answer is one word, <em>Stolidity!</em> These proceedings,
	which are called magnetic, or named after Mesmer, mesmeric,
	have had to battle for recognition, for existence even, against the
	college and the church. The medical and clerical professions have
	been everywhere educated to deny, despise, and resist this species of
	science, and would, if they had the power, suppress it by law, their
	education having made them ignorant of its merits and ignorant of
	its deeply interesting literature. Prejudice and ignorance are inculcated
	as easily as science, and they are inculcated in all colleges.</p>

	<p>But all who are acquainted with the history of animal magnetism
	during the present century know that it has nobly fulfilled its
	mission as a system of therapeutics, by alleviating or curing all forms
	of disease of both body and mind. That which cures bodily diseases
	and sometimes overcomes insanity has certainly power enough to
	modify the action of the brain; and if the large number of magnetic
	physicians who have been successfully occupied in conquering
	disease had been employed in modifying the action of the brain in
	the young, we might have had as satisfactory reports of their success,
	which neither the medical nor the clerical profession would have
	been so much moved by jealousy to oppose.</p>

	<p>In the light of anthropology, however, it is not necessary to
	adhere to the old formulæ of the followers of Mesmer. The hypnotic
	or mesmeric state is simply a condition arising from the exercise
	and predominance of a faculty belonging to all human beings,—a
	faculty which may be evoked by other methods, or by the voluntary
	action of the subject, or by the spontaneous action of the brain, as
	in those who in sleep pass into the state of somnambulism, and go
	forth in the night, walking in dangerous places with perfect safety,
	but in an unconscious state.</p>

	<p>This condition is also produced by gentle manipulations over the
	head toward the eyes, or upon the chest down to the epigastrium
	(pit of the stomach). The reason of these processes was entirely
	<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>unknown until my discovery of the organ of Somnolence in the
	temples, and the corresponding region in the body showed that the
	results were produced by manipulations which concentrated the
	nervous action to those two locations.</p>

	<p>The entranced or mesmeric state, in which the subject is in a
	dreamy condition with but little power of will and with extreme
	susceptibility, which is also a state of great mental clearness, may be
	produced by directly stimulating the proper organs with the fingers,
	which should be placed upon the organ of Somnolence on each side
	of the head, in the temples, about an inch horizontally
	behind the brow. <a href="images/fig1.png"><img src="images/fig1-th.png" class="illo_left" width="113" height="125" alt="Left profile view, with a circle around the temple area." /></a>In persons who are impressible
	this produces a quiet dreamy feeling, and a
	disposition to close the eyes. If carried further,
	the eyes become closed so that it is difficult to open
	them, and the unconscious state soon follows. The
	same effect may be produced by placing the hand
	on the body just below the breastbone (sternum). In this condition,
	the character, or action of the brain, is under the control of
	the operator, and by gently applying his hand over any portion of
	the brain, its organs may be brought into predominant activity, while
	other organs may be quelled or quieted by gentle dispersive manipulations.
	Thus, placing the hand gently on the top of the head,
	touching very lightly, all the amiable or moral organs will be
	brought into play, producing the most admirable and pleasing disposition;
	or if the operator has the necessary knowledge of the
	locations he may bring out each faculty separately, such as Love,
	Hope, Religion, Kindness, Conscientiousness, Firmness, Cheerfulness,
	Imitation, etc.</p>

	<p>At the same time, if there be any evil propensities, such as a
	quarrelsome, irritable temper, a love of turbulence and cruelty,
	selfishness, avarice, jealousy, etc., all of which lie at the base of the
	brain, they may be for the time entirely suppressed by gentle
	dispersive manipulations from the organs of such propensities either
	down toward the chest or upward.</p>

	<p>What I state thus of the moral and selfish tendencies or faculties
	is equally applicable to all the faculties and their organs. We may
	stimulate all forms of intelligence, observation, memory, or reason,
	or check excessive intellectual activity when it disturbs sleep and
	exhausts the brain. We may thus cultivate modesty, obedience,
	prudence, industry, application, imagination, refinement, truthfulness,
	faith, spirituality, originality, invention, literary capacity,
	patience, perseverance, fortitude, hardihood, health, temperance,
	and, in short, every good quality that we desire to see developed, if
	we understand cerebral science; and if we understand only its
	general-outlines we can at least improve the character by giving a
	predominance to the superior regions of the brain.</p>

	<p>But while this may be done more effectively in the somnolized
	condition, it is not absolutely necessary to induce that condition.
	Speaking of the entire fourteen hundred millions now on the globe,
	we may say that a large majority are susceptible, in various degrees,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>of feeling such influences without any previous somnolizing.
	Nearly all the inhabitants of the torrid zone are subject to such influences
	in their habitual condition, and actually require no medicine,
	because their treatment by the hand of an enlightened anthropologist
	familiar with therapeutic sarcognomy will control all their
	diseases. The greatest triumphs of sarcognomy are yet to be realized
	in such climates.</p>

	<p>In the United States, the susceptibility increases as we go South.
	The majority of the southern population are impressible, and there
	are some who would even maintain that a majority are, in the North;
	and certainly magnetic healers have been very successful in New
	England.</p>

	<p>But whatever may be the case with adults, I believe that a
	majority of the young everywhere possess a considerable degree of
	impressibility, and that the mother’s hand, gently applied upon the
	upper surface of the head, will generally quiet the evil passions and
	promote good humor.</p>

	<p>This is more especially true of girls. It is rare to find one who
	does not show in her youth, especially from ten to twenty years of
	age, a degree of susceptibility which makes her a good subject for
	the manual treatment of disease, and also for improving the action
	of the brain, by the scientific use of the hand upon the head, by
	which despondent, restless, fretful, hysterical, or other evil conditions
	may be quickly overcome. The speedy relief of headache is
	especially remarkable.</p>

	<p>My own experiments upon the brain have been made for the
	development and cultivation of science, or the assistance of the sick.
	I have not had time to undertake the systematic cultivation and
	change of character by such processes in the young; but when I see
	how quickly and completely the condition of a patient may be
	changed, and all cloudy, depressed conditions of the brain removed,—how
	easily I can produce a state of insanity, idiocy, or pugnacity,
	and as quickly remove it entirely,—I cannot doubt that a little
	perseverance in cultivating the nobler qualities until they become
	by habit a second nature will change even the most depraved, if the
	process be begun in childhood or youth and steadily maintained,
	unless there be a great organic deficiency in the brain, which cannot
	be remedied.</p>

	<p>The teacher of the future, duly educated in anthropology, will lay
	aside the rod, and will find in the scientific application of his hands
	the means of overcoming acquired or even hereditary evils; and
	special asylums will be established, in which the most degenerate
	youth may be restored to honor, not by cerebral treatment alone,
	but by all the appliances of industry, music, religion, and love, which
	have already reformed so many youthful criminals at Lancaster,
	Ohio, and given them to society as good citizens.</p>

	<p>The method of direct operation on the brain, which was introduced
	by my discovery in 1841, is that with which I am more
	familiar, but the mesmeric method has long been known, and the
	modification of this, which might be called the imaginative method,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>has been made familiar during the last fifty years under the popular
	name of psychology, and sometimes under the absurd name of
	electro-biology.</p>

	<p>This method is simply that of assuming control of the subject
	when he is in the passive state, and making him believe anything
	he is told, as, for example, that a handkerchief is a snake, that a piece
	of money is burning hot, or that he is a king, a hero, an orator, an
	auctioneer, or anything else suggested by the fancy of the operator,
	which is at once carried into personation by the subject. This is a
	familiar, popular exhibition, which never fails to attract and amuse,
	but has unfortunately not been applied to its philanthropic uses in
	healing disease and elevating the character. If disease can be overcome
	by making the subject believe a glass of pure water a powerful
	restorative medicine, or by believing himself marvellously well and
	vigorous; or if his vicious or indolent habits can be overcome by
	making him for a time believe himself a religious saint or an energetic
	business man,—such experiments should be made a powerful
	adjunct in education, and in the reformation of criminals; and this
	application has recently been made in France, which has the honor
	of leading in this important philanthropy.</p>

	<p>The passive state required may be produced by fixing the gaze
	intently for a few minutes upon some object near the eyes which
	requires them to be turned inward, or by gazing at the eyes of the
	operator. The operator tells him if his eyes are shut that he cannot
	open them, or that he cannot lift his foot, or cannot step across a
	certain mark, and he seems unable to do so, but does readily whatever
	his operator suggests, and believes himself to be whatever his
	operator says—experiments which have been made a source of
	infinite amusement to public audiences.</p>

	<p>For example, about forty-five years ago a Mr. Keeley was making
	such exhibitions in Louisville, and found an old lawyer named
	Dozier a good subject. He informed Mr. Dozier on the platform
	that he was Mr. Polk, President of the United States, whereupon he
	attempted to assume a corresponding dignity. Then, bringing up
	Mr. Geo. D. Prentice, the witty editor of the <cite>Louisville Journal</cite>, he
	informed the quasi-President Polk that this was his wife, Mrs. Polk,
	just arrived, whereupon an amusingly cordial reception of the quasi-wife
	occurred.</p>

	<p>The utilization of these principles by the French is shown in the
	following translation from the German.</p>

	<blockquote>
	<h3>HYPNOTISM AND EDUCATION.</h3>

	<p class="byline">BY EDGAR BERILLON.</p>

	<p class="trans_line">[Translated from the German in <cite>Sphinx</cite>, for the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>.]</p>

	<p>The careful study which the school of the medical faculty of Nancy has
	devoted to the phenomena of suggestion, and their actual progress in that
	department, present the question whether the time has not arrived for
	teachers to participate in this scientific movement.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>The numerous observations by Dr. August Voisin of the Salpetriere have
	positively proved in his own practice not only the curability of mental diseases,
	but the great assistance which may be given to moral culture, so
	that we might successfully introduce hypnotism in educational schools.
	Dr. Voisin with great ease cured his first patient in the trial of hypnotic
	suggestion—a girl by the name of Johanna Schaaf, who was not only a
	thief, but dissolute, lazy, and unclean. He transformed her into an honest
	industrious, neat, and obedient person. For several years she could not be
	induced to read a line. Under the control of Dr. Voisin she was made to
	read several pages of a moral work, which she repeated before the class.
	Then with great facility he roused her feelings of sympathy, which appeared
	to have become extinct. This cure was so thorough that she has
	since been appointed a nurse in the hospital, and has given complete satisfaction,
	showing herself quite conscientious.</p>

	<p>Many other experiments were made quite satisfactorily, and similar results
	were produced in his city practice. In one case, by hypnotic suggestion
	treatment Dr. Voisin transformed the character of a quarrelsome woman,
	making her a mild affectionate wife to her husband. Voisin’s experiments
	related principally to adults, but Dr. Liebeault of Nancy made experiments
	with children, of which he has mentioned two cases. Once a
	child was brought to his clinic with great suffering from a nervous affection,
	but would not submit to a hypnotic treatment till her little brother
	present offered himself, not being afraid. When he was put to sleep his
	mother told the physician that the boy in school was always in the lower
	grades, without making any progress. While in the sleep he was strongly
	impressed for diligence and zeal, and the subsequent result was perfect;
	within six weeks he became an example of diligence and perseverance,
	and soon got promoted. The second case was that of a young idiot. He
	was incapable of intellectual culture, and could not be taught reading or
	arithmetic. Dr. Liebeault submitted him to many hypnotic sittings, making
	a very great effort to rouse his attention, though he seemed to have no
	capacity for being instructed. Finally he succeeded so well that after two
	months he could read, and could cipher in the four rules of arithmetic. A
	great number of similar cases were treated by Dr. Dumont at Nancy with
	decided success.</p>

	<p>In one of his clinics Prof. Bernheim maintained that all children are receptive
	of hypnotic suggestion or transference of thought, and even more so
	when they enter the age of reasoning. Not only in sleep, but also in the
	waking condition, they may be affected; and the school of Nancy deserves
	great credit for presenting this important matter to the world in its true
	light.</p>

	<p>One of the signs of the hypnotic sleep or state is the automatic condition
	of the individual. In consequence of having for the time an enfeebled will,
	the individual will yield to all impressions upon it; and this weakness of
	will may take place in a wakeful state, when, if there is no opposition, the
	individual will accept all assurances in good faith. In case there is no
	exertion of influence by others, the subject will act by his or her own imagination.
	Such auto-suggestion is the result of a tendency to imitation which
	seems to be developed in children particularly, and develops in the waking
	state in undisciplined minds or in a fatigued and passive state.</p>

	<p>These important principles and facts render it the duty of every educator
	to study the efficacy of suggestion and imitation in children. The experiments
	made thus far, authorize us to establish the following rules for practice:</p>

	<p>If we have to deal with children of lazy, unintelligent, and indifferent
	character, we should confine ourselves to practicing verbal suggestion in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>their waking state, and to be effective it would be best to follow the experiments
	at Nancy, especially of Dr. Liebeault, and make great effort to gain
	the implicit confidence of the child. Seat it by itself on a chair, place your
	hand on its forehead, and enforce the suggestions by a mild voice and patient
	manner, but with firm determination.</p>

	<p>When, however, our treatment is to ameliorate the future destiny of the
	children,—when their faculty of observation is deficient, when they have
	no diligence whatever, and are full of vicious, headstrong, evil inclinations,
	it is our opinion that by all means we should apply hypnotism fully to these
	degenerate creatures. The suggestions in the hypnotic sleep are of greater
	efficacy, more durable and profound, and probably in many cases it will be
	necessary to repeat these procedures frequently, until the imperfect intellectual
	faculties are developed, and the evil inclinations suppressed. Thus
	may we guide these young souls to a better and purer future.</p>

	<p>In conclusion, I do not hesitate to assert the importance of hypnotism,
	in spite of all objections in its application to the mental and physical faculties
	of healthy persons. Its application as an educational method will be
	of vast importance to sick and depraved subjects.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>The train of thought in the above essay, which Dr. Berillon has
	published in the September number of his <cite>Revue de l’Hypnotisme</cite>,
	inspired the contents of a lecture presented at the Scientific Congress
	at Nancy (August, 1886), out of which arose a discussion in
	which Dr. Liebault observed that the facts mentioned by Dr. Berillon
	are entirely true. “My long practice,” said he, “has permitted
	me to gather a great number of other cases, which will sustain the
	doctrines of the speaker. I have never seen a child continue entirely
	unreceptive of suggestion treatment. In the persons, children, and
	adults, with whom I have experimented, counting by thousands, I
	have never observed the least injurious consequences whatever.”</p>


	<p class="post_break">The report of the discussion given us above in <cite>Sphinx</cite> shows that
	these important suggestions met with only one unfriendly criticism,
	and that of little force. M. Desjardins, Esq., suggested that it was
	highly important that other honorable gentlemen, like Dr.
	Liebault, Dr. Voisin, and Dr. Dumont, should be officially appointed
	to carry on such experiments. He expressed his desire that the
	Congress should recommend that hypnotic suggestion for the purpose
	of moral improvement should be tried upon the worst class of
	pupils in the public schools. The suggestion was seconded with energy
	by Dr. Leclerc, who expressed his surprise that any one should
	object. It may be said to have met with the general approbation of
	the Congress.</p>


	<p class="post_break">The <cite>Public Ledger</cite> of Philadelphia published last year the following
	sketch of the progress of the marvellous in France:</p>


	<blockquote>
	<h3>Marvels of Mind and Body.</h3>

	<p>For several years past a number of French physicians have been experimenting
	on hypnotised or mesmeric subjects and on hysterical patients, with
	results of the most extraordinary character. It is our purpose to very
	briefly describe some of these remarkable experiments, from which, we may
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>say, the standing of the doctors engaged in them, and the critical care with
	which they were conducted, seem to remove all questions of fraud or
	inaccuracy.</p>

	<p>In these hypnotic experiments as practised by Dr. Charcot, of the Salpetriere;
	by Dr. Bernheim, Professors Beaunis and Liegeois and other
	persons of high professional standing, the most striking feature is that the
	influence exerted upon the patient does not vanish with the conclusion of
	the experiment, but may produce its effects days, weeks or even months
	afterwards, when the patient is seemingly in a normal state and controlled
	solely by his own thoughts. For instance, a sensitive person may be
	hypnotised, or mesmerized, to use the better known word, and it be suggested
	to him by the experimenter to go at a certain hour of the next or
	some succeeding day and shoot some person and then deliver himself up to
	justice. On being brought back to the normal state no recollection
	of this suggestion is present in his mind. And yet, if the experiment work
	as truly as it often seemingly has worked, he will endeavor at the time
	fixed to perform the action indicated, with the full belief that the impulse
	to do so is his own. We may quote some instances in corroboration of
	this seemingly improbable statement.</p>

	<p><strong class="headline">Cases of Hypnotic Suggestion.</strong>—Among minor instances of this
	result, Frederick Myers relates that he suggested to a hypnotised subject,
	who was engaged in coloring a sketch, that it would be a good idea to paint
	the bricks blue. He repeated his suggestion several times, and then
	brought the subject to the normal state. She had no recollection of what
	had passed, yet on resuming her painting some time afterwards she hesitated,
	and then said to a lady companion, “I suppose it would never do to
	paint these bricks blue.” “Why blue?” “Oh, it only occurred to me
	that it would look rather nice.” She acknowledged that the idea of blue
	bricks had been persistently in her mind, with the notion that the color
	would look well.</p>

	<p>In another instance, Dr. Bernheim, of Nancy, suggested to a hypnotised
	person to take Dr. X.’s umbrella when awake, open it, and walk twice up
	and down the gallery. On being awakened he did so, but with the umbrella
	<em>shut</em>. When asked why he acted so, he replied: “It is an idea. I
	take a walk sometimes.” “But why have you taken Dr. X.’s umbrella?”
	“Oh, I thought it was my own. I will replace it.”</p>

	<p>These are harmless instances of this strange power. There are others
	the reverse of harmless in this significance. One or two of these we may
	quote: Prof. Liegeois, in his recently published pamphlet, “Of Hypnotism
	in its relations to Civil and Criminal Law,” describes experiments
	with the subjects of M. Liebault, a well-known hypnotiser. In these
	experiments he took pains to induce the patients to commit crimes. As he
	relates, Mdlle. A. E. (a very amiable young lady) was made to fire at her
	own mother with a pistol, which she had no means of knowing was unloaded.
	The same lady was made to accuse herself before a judge of having
	assassinated an intimate friend with a knife. Yet in both these instances
	she was wide awake at the time and supposed that she was acting from her
	own impulse.</p>

	<p>Many other instances might be given, but these will suffice for
	illustration. As to the length of time in which such a suggestion may
	remain operative, Prof. Beaunis relates a case in which he suggested to a
	hypnotised subject that he would call on her on the next New Year’s day
	(172 days after the date of the experiment). On that date, being perfectly
	conscious, she seemed to see him walk into the room where she was, pay his
	compliments, and retire. She insisted that this had really happened, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>could not be convinced to the contrary. A striking feature of this incident
	was that he seemed to be dressed in summer attire (as at the date of experiment),
	though it was now the dead of winter.</p>

	<p>A natural conclusion from the facts above detailed is, that the strange
	power here indicated might prove a very dangerous weapon in the hands of
	an unscrupulous man. If a person can suggest to a subject in the hypnotic
	sleep that, at a certain future day, he or she shall kill a person obnoxious
	to the experimenter, or perform some other criminal act, and if the act be
	duly performed, the subject being in a seemingly normal state, and fully
	convinced that he acted solely through an impulse originating in his own
	mind, it might appear as if there was little safety left for honest people,
	and that a villain might carry out his murderous schemes with perfect
	impunity. In such a case as we have said, the mind of the patient would
	cease to be his own, but would partly belong to the person whose deadly
	thoughts it contained, and whose involuntary agent it had become. Will
	the jurisprudence of the future have to take account of such possibilities as
	this? Yet it must be remembered that the great majority of people are
	not susceptible to hypnotic influence, and that those whose will can be so
	completely subjected to that of another are comparatively few. Very few
	such have yet been found in France. In America, the realm of a less excitable
	people, still fewer could be found.</p>

	<p>It may be said, moreover, that this influence in several cases has been
	exerted for the good of the patient. One instance is given in which the
	patient was a great smoker and drinker, and voluntarily gave up both
	under the influence of hypnotic suggestion. Several other cases of the
	same kind are related, while a humorous instance is given of an idle school
	boy who, impelled by a hypnotic suggestion, became a very ardent student.
	After working off that spell, however, he obstinately refused to be hypnotised
	again, apparently with the impression that there was something
	uncanny in his unusual fit of devotion to study.</p>

	<h2 class="title">The Grand Symposium of the Wise Men of the Nineteenth Century.</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">The</span> question of our future destiny is paramount to all others
	in dignity and importance. Upon this subject all wise men must
	have clear and positive views. The editor of the <cite>Christian Register</cite>
	of Boston, according to the very common idea that men in prominent
	positions as professors and decorated with college honors must be
	the wisest, thought it well to ask them if science could take cognizance
	of the question of immortality, and if its verdict was for or
	against a future life. Such questions he addressed to twenty-three
	professors, presidents, doctors of laws, etc. But he did not reflect
	that there were several hundred gentlemen in Boston who had more
	knowledge on this subject, and who could give him positive and
	reliable information, and he entirely forgot that the only scientist
	who has examined this question from the physiological standpoint
	resides in Boston.</p>

	<p>The editor did not obtain what he was ostensibly seeking, but he
	did obtain an amount of evidence of ignorance, in high places, which
	I should be happy to record, but for the fact that it would occupy
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>more than half of one number of the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>. Nevertheless,
	I cannot deprive my readers of the pleasure and amusement
	derived from this correspondence. I have condensed the responses
	into a readable compass leaving out their useless verbiage, and
	putting them in a poetic form, as poetry best expresses the essence
	and spirit of an author’s thought. I think the learned gentlemen, if
	they could peruse these doggerel rhymes, would acknowledge that
	their meaning has been expressed even more plainly and forcibly
	than in their own prose. The reader will observe that of the whole
	twenty-three only two appear to have any knowledge on the subject,
	the famous A. R. Wallace and the brilliant Dr. Coues. The following
	is the essence or rather quintessence of the voluminous responses
	in the order in which they were published. The learned gentlemen
	ought to feel grateful for the increased candor, brevity and explicitness
	of their replies, when boiled down into the rhyming form,
	bringing out new beauties which were not apparent in the original
	nebulous condition of vagueness in which some of them disclaim
	opposition to immortality, while their only immortality is that of
	atoms and force.</p>

	<p>While there is something amusing in these responses (which I
	shall carefully file away for the future), which may furnish matter
	for surprise and laughter in a more enlightened age, and which may
	cause the writers, if they live long enough, to realize a feeling of
	shame for the wilful ignorance or affectation of ignorance displayed,
	we cannot overlook the very serious fact that the educational
	leadership of our country is in the hands of men of whom a large
	proportion are destitute of the very foundation of the sentiment of
	religion, while another large portion are so utterly regardless of
	scientific truth as to ignore the best attested facts, which are continually
	in progress within their reach—a degree of bigotry which is
	not surpassed in the history of the “Dark Ages.” Verily the
	shadow of those ages rests upon the leading institutions of to-day.</p>

	<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>The Burning Question in Education.</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">If</span> our left hand had been mangled, and continued to be an inflamed,
	ulcerating mass, though carried in a sling and treated by all
	the surgeons of repute around us,—never through a long life giving
	any promise of restoration or even relief,—would not its restoration
	be the most prominent question in our minds?</p>

	<p>Society has a crushed, ulcerous, and painful hand upon which the
	doctors of the college and church have expended such skill as they
	have in their occasional perfunctory visits, and the hand grows no
	better, but rather worse, during the whole existence of the American
	Republic.</p>

	<p>The existence of an increasing mass of crime, pauperism, and
	insanity is the crushed and diseased hand of civilized society, to
	which and to its obvious, natural method of healing I have vainly
	endeavored, in the “New Education,” to call the attention of our
	clergy and our teachers. It is true that three editions of that book
	have been disposed of to the delight of progressive thinkers, but it
	has made little impression on those who control public institutions
	and public opinion. Why is this?</p>

	<p>There are sounds in nature too finely delicate to be heard by the
	average ear, and rays beyond the violet too fine for the average
	human eye, though visible to those of superior nervous endowments.
	So in the world of thought there are ethical conceptions too high
	and pure for the multitude,—conceptions so far away from their
	habitual life that they cannot appreciate or sympathize with them.
	Such conceptions constitute the ethical system of education, which
	is competent to banish crime, and to introduce a higher social condition,
	as has been amply proved by its imperfect introduction in
	the Lancaster, Ohio, and other reformatory schools.</p>

	<p>Why is not this made the prominent theme in every religious
	society, as prominent as temperance? True, intemperance supplies
	us the majority of criminals, but when the criminal is prepared in
	the hot-bed of alcohol, society transplants him into a richer soil,
	impregnated with a greater amount of filth than the saloon, and
	cultivates him into the full-blown, hardened villain, for whom
	there is nothing but a career of crime, very costly indeed to
	society.</p>

	<p>Why is this insane course pursued? Because society has not the
	Christianity which it professes, and the pulpit has not learned how
	to instil the Divine law of love, while the college cares nothing
	about it.</p>

	<p>Society itself is <em>criminally indifferent</em>, and barbarously cruel. Its
	only thought in reference to its debased members is not their lost
	condition, and how to redeem them, but how to punish them revengefully
	for their evil deeds, in imitation of the Divine Demon whom
	orthodox theology recognizes as its model. Until society has enough
	of benevolence or enough of practical sagacity to get rid of this
	common impulse of brute life, we shall continue to have an energetic,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"> </a>skilful, and formidable army of criminals, spread all over the land,
	levying an immense tax upon respectable citizens, and requiring an
	increasing army of police to restrain them.</p>

	<p>The best discourse that has yet been preached in a Boston pulpit
	was once delivered in Trinity Church by the assistant minister, Mr.
	Allen, a few weeks since, which was made the basis of an admirable
	article on “our prisoners” in the <cite>Banner of Light</cite> of April 2. Mr.
	Allen treated this subject in the spirit of the “New Education,”
	showing that our penal system, instead of reforming criminals,
	educates and perfects them in crime, under which system crime is
	continually and alarmingly increasing, the statistics which he gives
	being of the same terrible character as those presented in the “New
	Education,” showing that our demoralization is progressing beyond
	that of any other country. His statistics, which I have not examined
	in detail, show that there were more than eight times as many
	prisoners in this country in 1880 as there were in 1850. In Massachusetts,
	and especially in Boston, the proportion of criminal population
	was still greater.</p>

	<p>England, having adopted a reformatory system, has kept the
	criminal population in check,—brought it down to one in 18,000,
	while we have one to every 837, because our prisons are colleges of
	crime instead of houses of reformation. A criminal population of
	5,000 in Massachusetts is kept under this debasing system, excepting
	about 700 in the reformatory at Concord and the women’s prison at
	Sherburne. Our criminals are held for punishment amid evil
	influences, and turned out only qualified to prey upon society again,
	since they have the brand of shame upon them.</p>

	<p>The only proper and wholesome view of this subject, the only
	view compatible with ethical or religious principles, is that our unfortunate
	criminal brethren need our loving care instead of
	vindictive hate. They should never be sent to prison for any
	definite term of confinement, as a punishment, but, like lunatics and
	pauper patients, should be placed under care and control until they
	are cured. Every criminal who will not obey the law in freedom
	should be sent to prison for life, under a kind and humane system,
	there to earn his own support and in some cases to repay the damage
	he has done, and in all cases to remain there until he has, beyond all
	doubt, become so thoroughly reformed that he may be safely
	entrusted with freedom. To encourage in the work of reformation,
	he should be from time to time rewarded by enlargement of his
	privileges and enjoyments, just in proportion as he proves himself
	worthy; and after enjoying partial freedom for years, with faithful
	and exemplary deportment, he should be granted full liberty, on the
	sole condition of reporting himself at certain regular periods, that a
	supervision may be retained over his conduct, and confinement
	renewed if ever he should prove unworthy of entire freedom.</p>

	<p>This system has been tried with entire success, and travellers
	speak of seeing prisoners in Ireland half emancipated, working in
	the fields, whom they should not have distinguished from the
	common laborers. That courageous philanthropist, the late Burnham
	<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>Wardwell, adopted a system of moral government in the
	Virginia penitentiary, under which punishment was almost abolished;
	and he was able to send out convicts in the city, under paroles,
	without any doubt that they would faithfully return. Under a
	similar system at Lancaster, Ohio, walls and locks were made unnecessary,
	and the youthful convicts went out freely, when permitted
	to mingle with the neighboring youth. When their reformation was
	completed, which did not require over three years, they went forth
	to lead an honest life; and subsequent reports showed that they
	walked in the path of respectability and honor.</p>

	<p>The mother’s love never abandons the idiot and criminal; but,
	alas! society is neither mother nor father nor brother to its unfortunate
	members, and hence society suffers, as we ever suffer from
	violation of the Divine law.</p>

	<div id="misc1" class="miscellany_item">
		<p><strong class="headline">Bigotry and Liberality, Theology and Religion.</strong>—Upon
		these subjects it is customary to find a mingling of contradictions.
		Leading New England literati, who inherit all the narrowness and self-sufficiency
		of British conservatism, are frequently impelled to utter
		expressions which would lead the reader to think them persons of
		liberal and progressive minds. Such expressions we find in the
		writings of Dr. Holmes, a thorough medical bigot and sceptic; R.
		W. Emerson, who closed his eyes against modern spiritual science,
		and adored the ignorance of Greece; Col. Higginson, the most intolerant
		and scornful opponent of psychic science; Dr. F. H. Hedge and
		President Elliot, who represent the status of Harvard College. This
		was recently brought to mind by seeing the admirable expressions of
		Dr. Hedge at the 150th anniversary of West Church, Boston, now
		under the ministry of Rev. C. A. Bartol. For this church Dr.
		Hedge claims an unsectarian character.</p>

		<p>Dr. Hedge says, “Let there be schools of dogmatic theology, as
		many as you please, but the church should not be a school of dogmatic
		theology. It should be a school of practical Christianity,
		inspired, expounded, and enforced by the pulpit. I can conceive of
		a church which should be so undogmatic, so unpolemic, as to command
		the respect, engage the interest, and secure the co-operation of
		all who care less for the prevalence of their specialty than they do
		for the maintenance of public worship.” There is one Boston pulpit
		at present conducted in this spirit, but it is very feebly sustained.
		There was another, and it was occupied with brilliant ability, but
		Boston would not sustain it. It is vacant now. Boston prefers theology
		to religion, but it is growing slowly, and there are pulpits that
		are slowly approaching the unsectarian position—very slowly; while
		the Rev. Mr. J. Savage displays a refreshing freedom of thought,
		and has been more successful than any other clergyman in carrying
		a large congregation with him, a solitary specimen of a successful
		though unsectarian teacher in Boston.</p>

	<div id="misc2" class="miscellany_item">
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"> </a><strong class="headline">Religious News.</strong>—“During the past few months, the Chinese
		authorities in various parts of the empire have issued proclamations
		to the people, calling on them to live at peace with Christian missionaries
		and converts, and explaining that the Christian religion
		teaches men to do right, and should therefore be respected. These
		documents have been published in so many parts of China that it is
		probable that every viceroy in the eighteen provinces has received
		instructions on the subject, and that there is a concerted movement
		throughout the empire to bring all classes of the population to a
		knowledge of the dangers of persecuting missionaries and native
		Christians, and to remove popular delusions respecting the objects
		and teachings of Christian missionaries.”</p>

		<p>“The Jesuits appear to meet with little toleration anywhere but
		in Great Britain. The sultan has now issued a decree enacting that
		henceforth they are not to open any new schools in the Ottoman
		empire, that they are not to teach except in schools placed under
		the authority of the Porte, and that all the schools now conducted
		by them are placed under the supervision of the State, and must be
		subjected to a rigorous supervision.”</p>

		<p>“Divine worship is a somewhat costly affair in Great Britain, says
		the <cite>World</cite>. The one hour’s service in Westminster Abbey on the
		21st of June, when the great personages of the realm are to assemble
		for the purpose of prayer, is to cost the moderate sum of $100,000.
		Commoners and ordinary people will not be admitted within the
		portals of the sacred edifice, yet it is their pockets which will be
		taxed for the purpose of enabling the princes and lords to pray in
		due state for the preservation of the Queen.”</p>

		<p>“The monument to the memory of Giordano Bruno in Rome, is
		completed, but permission to erect it has been refused by the Municipal
		Council of that holy city. This denial is easily explained when
		it is learned that a majority of the council are clergymen, or under
		their influence.”</p>

		<p>Governor Marmaduke has signed the bill recently passed by the
		Missouri legislature, making Sunday virtually a Puritanical Sabbath.
		A powerful protest was presented to the Governor, respectfully
		requesting him not to sign the obnoxious bill, but it seems he yielded,
		says the <cite>Jewish Times</cite>, to the wishes of a few fanatics, backed by
		scheming politicians.</p>

		<p><strong class="headline">Abolishing Slavery.</strong>—It is pleasant to learn that the movement

		fixed the date by which every slave in the empire must be freed;
		but the chamber of deputies, acting in opposition to the senate, has

		the latest day of enfranchisement a further 18 months. The

		purchased a young boy slave for one hundred roubles, the average price

		<p><strong class="headline">Old Fogy Biography.</strong>—It seems that biography as well as

		<cite>Appleton’s Cyclopedia of American Biography</cite> has sent out its first
		volume, edited by Gen. Wilson and Prof. John Fiske. The sources
		of this volume do not promise much liberality, and the first volume
		does not show it. While professing to record the lives of all who are
		eminent or noteworthy, it fulfils this promise by recording many
		who are not very eminent or noteworthy; indeed, Mr. Lowell says,
		by way of commendation, that he has hunted for obscure names and

		Cassius M. Clay, our former minister to Russia, one of the most
		conspicuous figures for many years in American politics and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par

		His life, recently published is a volume of fascinating and
		romantic interest. Mr. Clay might treat this omission as the old
		Roman said of having a statue in the forum—that he would rather
		men should ask why he had <em>no</em> statue there, than to ask why his
		statue was there. Dr. Joseph Rodes Buchanan is briefly noticed, his
		name incorrectly spelled, a catalogue of his publications given, and a
		volume attributed to him which was written by the notorious Dr.
		John Buchanan of Philadelphia. But nothing is said of the new
		school of philosophy, or of the new sciences, established by Dr.
		Buchanan. Evidently this is old fogy biography. The editors have

		experience in hypnotism, showing that somnambulic or mesmeric
		subjects were not accountable for their acts in that condition. In
		this case, the patient, a youth of nineteen years, had been subject to
		somnambulic attacks in which he acted strangely, and, on one occasion,
		had openly taken several articles of furniture from a shop, for
		which he was arrested, when he fell again into somnolence and
		was sent to the Hotel Dieu. Dr. Mesnet, for an experiment, gazed
		firmly at him, and got him in magnetic rapport and then ordered
		him to steal the watch of one of the students the next day. He
		manifested a great deal of repugnance to this command, but yielded,
		and the next day came with the student, with whom he talked.
		After a time he fixed his eyes on the student’s watch and appeared
		mentally agitated, his breathing hurried, and his limbs trembling,
		his face red in one part and pallid in another. In this condition,
		he put forth his hand in an indecisive manner, stole the watch, put
		it in his pantaloons pocket, and ran down the stairs, where he was
		arrested and wakened up. He indignantly denied the theft, and
		fell into such agitation it required a number to hold him. He fell
		again into the hypnotic state from which they could not rouse him
		then, as it was owing to a mental cause. Dr. M. concluded by

		<p><strong class="headline">Pasteur’s Cure for Hydrophobia.</strong>—I am by no means convinced

		Society has published a tabular statement, which shows that from
		March, 1885, to the present date, 63 persons who have been
		treated by his system have died. Against this, I should like to
		know how many persons really suffering from hydrophobia have
		been cured by it.</p>

		<p>The immense interest of the medical profession and the public in
		Pasteur’s method of inoculation with hydrophobia virus is due
		mainly to the <em>Stolid Skepticism</em> of the medical profession. Other
		methods of cure have been far more successful, but they have been
		shamefully neglected, for medical colleges are always indifferent, if
		not hostile to improvements not originating in their own clique.
		The cures that have been effected by the use of Scutellaria (Skull-cap),
		and of Xanthium are far beyond anything achieved by inoculation.
		I recollect many reports published by farmers, about sixty
		years ago, of their cures of hydrophobia by skull-cap.</p>

		<p>“Ramon was not the forty-fifth, but the seventy-sixth patient who

		Of these seventy-six victims thirty-nine were inoculated in Paris
		under the first method, seventeen in Russia and twenty in Paris
		under the second or ‘intensive’ method. For the verification of this

		‘M. Pasteur et la Rage’ by M. Zutand, editor of the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de

	<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>Genesis of the Brain</h3>

<p class="subtitle">(<em>Continued from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26317/26317-h/26317-h.htm#page32" title="Go to Buchanan’s Journal of Man, May 1887.">page 32</a>.</em>)</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">Is</span> there anything miraculous or extravagant in believing that this
	invisible potentiality, which has such magical transforming and
	developing power, but which has never been known to arise from
	combinations of matter, has an origin which is, like itself, spiritual?
	For we can obtain matter from matter, and spirit from spirit, but
	never obtain spirit or life from dead matter.</p>

	<p>The genesis of the human brain is therefore a microcosmic epitome
	of the macrocosmic evolution, controlled by the “over-soul”—the
	Divine power, of which we know so little.</p>

	<p>To return to the embryo brain, which gives us visibly the epitome
	of the evolution of vertebrated animals,—why is it not also an
	epitome of the entire animal kingdom, from the radiata, articulata,
	and mollusca to the vertebrata, instead of representing the evolution
	of vertebrates alone? It may be so. It may be that man and other
	animals in germination pass through <em>all</em> stages, from the lowest to
	the highest; but the microscope cannot reveal the fact, for the jelly-like
	or fluid conditions of the nervous system during the first month
	after conception do not enable us to discover any organization or
	outline from which anything can be learned. And yet, from certain
	interesting experiments in sarcognomy which have never been performed
	except by myself or my pupils, I am disposed to believe that
	the germinal process of man goes beyond the beginning of the animal
	kingdom, and that he retains in his constitution spiritual elements
	which might not improperly be called, not a photograph, but a
	psychograph of the entire animal kingdom,—yea, of everything that
	lives, and even of the mineral elements that have no life.</p>

	<p>These things are wonderful and grand indeed, but the self-sufficient
	powers that rule the world of human society have no desire
	to know them, and hence I have been content to enjoy them alone,
	or with a few enlightened friends.</p>

	<p>It is in the second month of life in the womb that the fish form of
	brain is distinctly apparent, as shown by Tiedemann. The fish
	form is that in which we have only a rudiment of the cerebrum,
	which is so large in man. Behind the little cerebrum, which is
	smaller than the bulb of the olfactory nerve, we have the middle
	brain or optic lobes, which give origin to the optic nerves, and
	behind them the cerebellum.</p>

	<p>Let it be understood that the cerebrum is the psychic
	brain, the cerebellum the physiological brain, and
	the optic lobes the intermediate or psycho-physiological
	brain, not sufficient to give the animal its character
	and propensities, but sufficient to guide it in
	swimming about.</p>

	<p>What the cerebrum is when fully developed in
	man has already been shown; what it is in the fishy
	stage of development, when it is the smaller portion
	of the brain, may be understood by a dissection given
	in Serres “Anatomie Comparée du Cerveau,” representing
	the brain of the codfish dissected or opened
	from above. <a href="images/fig2.png"><img src="images/fig2-th.png" class="illo_left" width="114" height="218" alt="Fish brain described in text." /></a>In this figure H is the spinal cord, E the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>cerebellum, C the optic lobes divided, and B the cerebrum divided,
	showing the radiating fibres of the corpus striatum, m, from which
	the cerebrum begins its development.</p>

	<p>When animal life reaches a high development, the functions which
	are diffused become concentrated into special organs. Intelligence
	or psychic life is concentrated in the cerebrum, and entirely removed
	from the spinal cord. The physiological energy apart from the
	psychic, is concentrated in the cerebellum, and thus the intermediate
	psycho-physiological organ, the optic lobes or quadrigemina, being
	no longer important, dwindles to become the smallest part of the brain.</p>

	<div class="illo_right" style="width:235px;clear:right;padding:1em;">
		<a href="images/fig3.png"><img src="images/fig3-th.png" width="235" height="259" alt="Three brains described next in text." /></a>
		<p class="caption"><strong class="headline">Explanation.</strong>—In the codfish, roach, and
		flounder, II is the cerebellum, n the optic
		lobes, in front of which is the cerebrum, from
		which the olfactory nerve extends forward.
		Behind the cerebellum is the superior end of
		the spinal cord. The letter c is placed on
		the restiform bodies or posterior part of the
		medulla oblongata of the cod. The engravings
		show the upper surfaces of the brains,
		as we look down upon them.</p>
	</div>

	<p>If the reader will look at the
	sketch of the brains of the codfish,
	flounder, and roach, as figured by
	Spurzheim, he will see in each a
	very small cerebrum, a larger cerebellum,
	and still larger middle brain
	or optic lobes. This is the model
	on which the human brain is first
	developed, when in the second
	month it becomes possible to study
	it with the microscope. It presents
	to view in the third month three
	vesicles of soft neurine, the one
	which is to form the cerebellum
	being larger than that which is to
	become the cerebrum.</p>

	<p>These are three brains of different
	grades, formed alike on the same
	vesicular plan. The resemblance of
	the optic lobes to the cerebrum is
	very striking, and when we open
	them we see what corresponds to
	the lateral ventricles of the cerebrum, with a structure at the bottom
	corresponding in position and character with the inferior ganglion of
	the cerebrum. The subdivision of function is similar to that of the
	cerebrum, the anterior portion of these lobes being of an intellectual,
	perceptive character, and the posterior the seat of the impulses.
	This has been demonstrated also in the experiments of vivisectors,
	in which the irritation of the posterior part has produced a vocal
	utterance or bark. Spurzheim gives a view of the brain of the pike
	with an optic lobe partially opened, to show the ventricle.</p>

	<p>The cerebellum or physiological brain is formed on the same
	general plan, having its energetic or forcible functions in the posterior
	inferior regions, and its more sensitive functions located anteriorly.</p>

	<p>In the embryo of twelve weeks a great advance has taken place;
	the optic lobes or quadrigemina are still large, but the cerebrum is
	larger than all the remainder. Still, it has not yet developed what
	might be called frontal and occipital lobes. The basis of the middle
	lobe, which is the most physiological portion of the cerebrum, being
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>devoted to the sensibility, appetites, and muscular impulses,
	is that which first presents itself, being the first
	outgrowth from the great inferior ganglion or summit
	of the spinal system. <a href="images/fig4.png"><img src="images/fig4-th.png" class="illo_right" width="99" height="122" alt="Brain at 12 weeks." /></a>As human brains degenerate to
	a lower type they approximate this form. The frontal
	and occipital lobes dwindle and the principal mass
	remaining is that in the basis of the skull between
	the ears. We see this form distinctly in congenital
	idiots. The embryo cerebrum here represented measures but
	three lines vertically, four lines in length, and five lines in thickness.
	(The line is the twelfth of an inch.) The nerve membrane of this
	hollow cerebrum is barely a fourth of a line thick. The cerebellum,
	formed in the same way by projection from the summit of the spinal
	cord, making two leaves that come together on the median line, has
	also a cavity contained between them, and just behind the medulla
	oblongata, which is finally reduced to the little space called the
	fourth ventricle, when the cerebellum grows to become a solid body.</p>

	<p>The growth of the cerebrum and cerebellum into solid bodies
	instead of vesicles is effected by the folding together of the primitive
	membrane as furrows appear upon its surface, by which it is
	changed into folds or convolutions, each of which (like the fold of a
	ruffle) may be cut out from its neighbors and opened from its inner
	side, like a book. It resembles a book also in the fact that it contains
	innumerable ideas or psychic elements, and the psychometer
	might read from each convolution as a book the impressions recorded
	in it. In its place in the brain it is like a book in a library; and as
	the book offers on its back a title expressive of its contents, so we
	label each convolution with its proper title.</p>

	<p>In addition to the folding process, a complex growth of fibres
	uniting in the corpus callosum completes the solidification, but not
	so thoroughly as to prevent our reopening and spreading out the convolutions
	by exercising a little dexterity. This was a puzzle to some
	of the anatomists in the time of Gall, but I have found no difficulty
	in opening out the convolutions to the extent of five or six inches
	square. The cerebellum, too, though its ventricle is obliterated, is
	susceptible also of a manipulation, showing that it has some traces of
	its original formation.</p>

	<p>From the twelve weeks embryo to those of twenty-one weeks and
	of seven months we trace a progressive development and a commencement
	of the furrows that form the convolutions.</p>

		<a href="images/fig5.png"><img src="images/fig5-th.png" width="510" height="280" alt="Two brains described in text (21 weeks and 7 months)." /></a>
		<p class="caption">In the brain of seven months, the right hemisphere is out open horizontally, showing the ventricle.	</p>
	</div>

	<p>Thus we perceive in the essential plan of the brain its two organs,
	cerebrum and cerebellum, are hollow spheres which grow gradually into
	solid bodies, filling their interior cavities, of which the lateral ventricles
	in the cerebrum, which have been explained, are the remnants.</p>

	<p>The great importance of these anatomical details arises from the
	fact that they show us the true central region of the brain from
	which its development must be determined; and although this
	work, designed for the general reader, cannot say much of the
	brain, it is necessary to show its true conformation to enable us to
	estimate the living brain correctly, so as to describe accurately
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>living men, study the forms of crania, and derive some profit in
	ethnological studies from the forms of crania which to the ethnologists
	of the present time are of very little value or significance, since
	they neither have nor claim a knowledge of the psychic functions
	of the brain. I trust, therefore, my readers will not neglect these
	anatomical memoranda, which they will find very valuable.</p>

	<p>I am not aware that any anatomical, physiological, or phrenological
	writer has given the exposition of the principles of cerebral
	development which I have been presenting for nearly half a century,
	although the anatomical facts are patent to all who choose to
	examine cerebral embryology, and think of what dissection reveals,
	instead of being thoughtlessly occupied in the mere details of
	dissection without rising to a comprehension of the Divine plan.
	Indeed, the phrenological school have positively misconceived and
	misstated the principles of cerebral development. We can hardly
	be said to have had any phrenological anatomists since the time of
	Gall and Spurzheim sufficiently interested in comparative human
	development to trace its basis in anatomy, for the able work of
	Solly presented the brain solely as seen by the science of dissection,
	and not by the science of development and psychic function.</p>

	<p>Gall and Spurzheim, understanding cerebral structure themselves,
	failed to state certain principles which were necessary to guard
	against misconception; and they did not realize its necessity, because
	their methods did not include the functions of the base of the
	brain. Mr. George Combe, who has been the great popular exponent
	of their system, for which he was well qualified by his clear,
	philosophic mind, adopted the erroneous idea, in which he has been
	followed by all subsequent writers on the subject, that the cerebral
	organs were to be regarded as so many cones, starting from their
	apex at the medulla oblongata and extending to their base at the
	surface of the skull. Hence their development was to be estimated
	by measuring the distance (with a pair of callipers) from the cavity
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>of the ear (which corresponds very nearly to the medulla oblongata)
	to the locations of the organs on the frontal superior and posterior
	surfaces of the head.</p>

	<p>In my first study of phrenology over fifty years ago, I adopted
	this method, and diligently measured heads with callipers, relying on
	the results, until I found them decidedly erroneous. I came upon
	the astounding fact that the head of a prominent citizen of New
	Orleans, when measured in this way, indicated by the height of the
	upper region a character entitling him to rank among the saints,
	when in fact he was notorious for the unrestrained energy of his
	violent and vicious propensities. Engaging then in more careful
	study and dissection of the brain, I found why the rule was so
	deceptive; as the basilar region is developed below the ventricles,
	giving depth, while the coronal region developed above gives height,
	and the measurement from the ear to the top of the head included
	both depth and height, it might be a very large measurement from
	animal predominance or basilar depth alone, as it was in the case
	that first revealed the error of Mr. Combe.</p>

	<p>In such cases of animal predominance we find that the moral
	region does not rise above the forehead, but runs back flat without
	elevation, while the depth of the ear below the level of the brain and
	the massiveness of the base of the brain running into a large neck
	show plainly that the animal organs rule.</p>

	<p>In the more noble characters, the rounded elevation of the coronal
	region, combined with the moderate depth and thickness of the base
	of the brain, make it easy to see that their vertical measurement is
	due to height and not to depth. The great error of the phrenological
	school has been in estimating moral development by the total
	vertical measurement, and estimating animal development without
	regard to depth, which is its chief indication.</p>

	<p>In a profile view, a line drawn from the middle of the forehead
	backward, horizontally, is sufficiently near the line of the lateral
	ventricles to enable us to compare the upward and downward
	development of the brain. In the two profiles here presented we see
	a marked difference of character illustrated by drawing a line back
	horizontally from the brow. The head in front, which is that of a
	private citizen of excellent character, named Smith, I obtained in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>Florida nearly fifty years ago. At the same time I obtained the
	other, which is that of a French count who lost his life on the coast
	of Florida by wreck when engaged in a contraband slave trade with
	Cuba. In the count we observe much less elevation and much
	greater depth. He is especially deficient in Benevolence.</p>

	<p>In proportion as men or animals rise in the scale of virtue the
	brain is developed above the level of the face, and in proportion as
	they incline to gross brutality the development falls behind the face;
	and there is no exception to this law, either in quadrupeds, birds, or
	reptiles. Indeed, notwithstanding the smallness of the brains of
	fishes, their portraits show that this law applies also to them—as if
	nature had determined to warn mankind of the character of every
	animal. Alas for the dulness of human observers! Our naturalists
	and anatomists have said not one word of the most conspicuous fact
	that may be seen in the general survey of the animal kingdom.<a href="#footnote_3" id="fnm3" title="The reader may naturally..." class="fnmarker">3</a></p>

	<p>To return to the theory of cerebral development: The reader
	will understand by referring to the last chapter that the summit of
	the spinal system or great inferior ganglion of the brain, bearing the
	names of optic thalami and corpora striata, is the true beginning
	of the cerebrum, instead of the medulla oblongata, which <em>does not</em>
	contain the fibres of the cerebral organs. <a href="images/fig7.png"><img src="images/fig7-th.png" class="illo_right" width="151" height="177" alt="Right profile sketch." /></a>And as this beginning is
	a little in front of the ear and its first radiating fibres are nearly on
	the horizontal line just mentioned, it follows that we may locate
	accordingly a centre from which cerebral development may be estimated;
	and when we take this true centre
	we may describe around it a circle, and find
	that the circle singularly coincides with the
	outline of the cranium, so that if we add to
	that circle the outlines of the nose, mouth,
	and chin, we have sketched a well-developed
	head of strong character, and ascertained
	the method of studying the development
	of the brain, which has so remarkably been
	overlooked.</p>

	<p>No one can begin the study of brain
	development in men and animals guided by
	a correct system without being delighted
	with the uniform accuracy of the science; for even the incomplete
	and inaccurate science of Gall and Spurzheim, marred in its application
	by misconceptions of anatomy, has proved sufficiently correct
	and instructive to maintain its hold upon the minds of all students
	of nature, by giving them more truth than error, and <em>sometimes</em>
	giving the truth with marvellous accuracy. The errors they did
	not attempt to investigate.<a href="#footnote_4" id="fnm4" title="I would merely..." class="fnmarker">4</a></p>

			<p>Mr. Lowell, having been minister to England, is profoundly reverenced in Boston for his social
			position. His position gives great weight to his suggestions. It is a moral power for the use of which
			he is responsible, but with which he has trifled. When a few earnest reformers thought that Mr.
			Gladstone’s grand statesmanship in preserving the peace of the world deserved to be recognized and
			honored by Americans, conservative, rank-worshipping Bostonians thought it would be <em>indispensable</em>
			to have Mr. Lowell’s co-operation, and waited his return from Europe. When Mr. Lowell was
			appealed to be had nothing to say,—he <em>wanted rest!</em> And Boston had nothing to say on that grand
			occasion, though Boston has a perfunctory Peace Society!</p>

			<p>But now Mr. Lowell comes out to call forth Bostonians for his chosen themes, and what are they?
			The discussion of old English dramatists! If there is anything more dead and worthless than antiquated
			plays which are forgotten, what is it? If there is anything more worthy of the name of <em>rubbish</em>,
			pray let us know what it is. But Boston crowds to hear disquisitions which from men in a
			different social position would be voted a bore, and sits reverently and patiently to catch his feeble
			and to many, scarce audible utterances. Is not this the worship of triviality and trash! How
			different would have been the action of John Hancock, of Samuel Adams, of Fisher Ames, or of
			Wendell Phillips. The atmosphere of European courts is debilitating to American Republicanism,
			unless it be a profound sentiment of the heart. When my brother-in-law returned from his position
			as minister to Naples, I could see that he had learned to look upon the common people as a rabble,
			and to sympathize only with the aristocracy. Cassius M. Clay at St. Petersburg learned to sympathize
			with the Russians, but he returned with no impairment of his democratic principles. <a href="#fnm1" title="Return to marker 1" class="returnFN">Return</a></p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"> </a>BUSINESS DEPARTMENT.</h2>

	<div class="ad_narrow">
		<p>The establishment of a new Journal is a hazardous
		and expensive undertaking. Every reader of
		this volume receives what has cost more than he
		pays for it, and in addition receives the product of
		months of editorial, and many years of scientific,
		labor. May I not therefore ask his aid in relieving
		me of this burden by increasing the circulation of
		the Journal among his friends?</p>

		<p>The establishment of the Journal was a duty.
		There was no other way effectively to reach the
		people with its new sphere of knowledge. Buckle
		has well said in his “History of Civilization,” that
		“No great political improvement, no great reform,
		either legislative or executive, has ever been originated
		in any country by its ruling class. The first
		suggestors of each steps have invariably been bold
		and able thinkers, who discern the abuse, denounce
		it, and point out the remedy.”</p>

		<p>This is equally true in science, philanthropy, and
		religion. When the advance of knowledge and
		enlightenment of conscience render reform or revolution
		necessary, the ruling powers of college,
		church, government, capital, and the press, present
		a solid combined resistance which the teachers of
		novel truth cannot overcome without an appeal to
		the people. The grandly revolutionary science of
		Anthropology, which offers in one department (Psychometry)
		“the dawn of a new civilization,” and
		in other departments an entire revolution in social,
		ethical, educational, and medical philosophy, has
		experienced the same fate as all other great scientific
		and philanthropic innovations, in being compelled
		to sustain itself against the mountain mass
		of established error by the power of truth alone.
		The investigator whose life is devoted to the evolution
		of the truth cannot become its propagandist.
		A whole century would be necessary to the full
		development of these sciences to which I can give but
		a portion of one life. Upon those to whom these
		truths are given, who can intuitively perceive their
		value, rests the task of sustaining and diffusing the
		truth.</p>

		<p>The circulation of the Journal is necessarily
		limited to the sphere of liberal minds and advanced
		thinkers, but among these it has had a more warm
		and enthusiastic reception than was ever before
		given to any periodical. There must be in the
		United States twenty or thirty thousand of the
		class who would warmly appreciate the Journal,
		but they are scattered so widely it will be years
		before half of them can be reached without the
		active co-operation of my readers, which I most
		earnestly request.</p>

		<p>Prospectuses and specimen numbers will be furnished
		to those who will use them, and those who
		have liberal friends not in their own vicinity may
		confer a favor by sending their names that a prospectus
		or specimen may be sent them. A liberal
		commission will be allowed to those who canvass for
		subscribers.</p>

		<div class="subsection">
			<h3>Enlargement of the Journal.</h3>

			<p>The requests of readers for the enlargement of
			the Journal are already coming in. It is a great
			disappointment to the editor to be compelled each
			month to exclude so much of interesting matter, important
			to human welfare, which would be gratifying
			to its readers. The second volume therefore
			will be enlarged to 64 pages at $2 per
			annum.</p>

			<p>“Irene, or the road to Freedom.” 612
			pages, $1; published by H. N. Fowler, 1123 Arch
			street, Philadelphia; called the “Uncle Tom’s
			Cabin of Woman Slavery.” Ostensibly a novel, it
			is a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doctrinaire</em> book, presenting a series of almost
			impossible incidents to enable the characters to
			present their ideas of woman’s rights and wrongs
			and conjugal relations. The full development of
			the writer’s doctrines (who is a woman) is postponed
			to another volume. The ideas in this would
			please only the most extreme radicals. The Journal
			is over-loaded with its special themes, and has not
			room for discussions of such subjects.</p>

		<h3>COLLEGE OF THERAPEUTICS.</h3>

		<p>The eighth session is now in progress with an
		intelligent class. The ninth session will begin next
		November. I do not approve of medical legislation,
		but if it could be considered just to prohibit
		medical practice without a college education, it
		would be much more just to prohibit magnetic and
		electric practice without such practical instruction
		as is given in the College of Therapeutics and at
		present nowhere else.</p>
